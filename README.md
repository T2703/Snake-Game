# Snake-Game
First attempt at a snake game using Python. Generally wanted to create a game and get a feel for what it's like. I also wanted to get more involved with Python. It's not perfect by any means and I know there are improvements I can make but I did get it done and working and that's enough to make me happy.

To start the game the player has to move the snake with the arrow keys and for those who don't know how the game works, you have to get your snake to eat as much food as possible to get a high score while
Avoid hitting the edges of the game or your growing snake if you do, it is a game over.
